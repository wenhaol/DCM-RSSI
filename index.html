        <h1>Dataset Description</h1>
        <p>This page describes the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data collected from different Wi-Fi router position in the <a href="https://viscenter.charlotte.edu/about"> VisCenter</a> at <b>UNC Charlotte</b> between January 21st and January 25th, 2024. Stickers were placed in alignment creating 9 columns and 11 rows, along with 2 obstacles. Each round of data collection, A <a href="https://global.agilex.ai/products/limo-pro">Limo Robot</a>  was placed in the environment and recorded the strength of the Wi-Fi signal while driving over each of the stickers by human.

       <h2>Environment Description</h2>

            </figure>
        </div>
        <p>The delineation of the workspace is established through the strategic arrangement of distinct materials. After mapping progrss, the robot generates <a href="web/Vis_map.pgm" target="_blank">Vis_map.pgm</a> file (as shown in <a href="#second-image">Fig.2</a>) and <a href="web/Vis_map.yaml" target="_blank">Vis_map.yaml</a> file. And we provide the <a href="web/map_to_pgm.py" target="_blank">mappping file (Python script)</a> to map the position information on the x and y coodination to the pixel information on the pgm file. As depicted in <a href="#second-image">Fig.2</a>, the metallic barrier is constituted by Aluminum Foil, serving as a reflective surface, while the wooden partition is constructed using a robust wood board. The workspace spans a stable area, measuring 5.76 meters in length and 3.84 meters in width.</p>
        <P>The workspace can be easily replicated in the real world using the files we have provided, or it can be used to generate a simulated environment for algorithm validation. Researchers can directly adopt our dataset for their studies.</P>
        <h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
         <p>The comprehensive dataset is compiled through the diligent data collection efforts of LIMO robots. Each .txt file within the dataset meticulously records the signal strength information gathered by the robots at various calibration points, corresponding to the distinct locations of the router. Every file is systematically named to reflect the specific position of the router during that measurement round. The overall project is structured as follows:</p>
        <div class="directory-structure">
       <ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Dataset
                <ul>
                    <li class="file">Router_{Column}{Raw}.txt <span class="note">(Replace {Column} and {Raw} with specific numbers)</span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
</ul>
        </div>
        Each router position is shown in this figrue:
        <figure class="centered-figure">

            <figcaption>Fig 3: Router position.</figcaption>
         </figure>

<p> Each .txt file is meticulously structured and includes the following elements: x and y coordinates representing the measurement position, x_map and y_map pixels within the PNG file of the generated map, and the corresponding RSSI measurement value. Each .txt data structure is as follows:</p>
        <table>
    <tr>
        <th>x: metes</th>
        <th>y: metes</th>
        <th>x_map: pixel</th>
        <th>y_map: pixel</th>
        <th>RSSI: db</th>
    </tr>
    <!-- Data rows would go here -->
</table>
